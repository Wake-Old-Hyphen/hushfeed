/**
 * The service's check of whether this phone can use passkeys at all (`LJJIJIIJIL` on 47.1.4,
 * read from the fixture's dex). In order it asks a server flag, that the account isn't one
 * TikTok restricts, Android 9 or newer, Google Play services 230815045 (23.08.15) or newer, and
 * that `GoogleApiAvailability` reports Play services available. It's the only method in the
 * class that asks GoogleApiAvailability, which keeps its own name as a library class, and it
 * isn't on the interface.
 *
 * <p>Two of the service's own gates call it, and nothing else does. `LJIIZILJ` (server flag,
 * Android 9, this check) is the one the rest of the app asks through the interface, and
 * `LIZJ` builds on it. `LJII` adds a store region list and decides the passkey upsell popup.
 * Each answers no as soon as this does, and every caller of theirs on 47.1.4 already has a
 * route for no:
 * - `LoginService.loginByMethodName`, passkey method: calls `downgradeToNormalLogin`, which runs
 *   the caller's normal login.
 * - `LoginService.doPasskeyLoginWithChallenge`, a saved account's passkey login: runs the
 *   fallback it was handed.
 * - The automatic prompt on the login and sign-up pages (`X/0li6`, chosen in its `LJII`, in
 *   sign-up's onCreate, in `X/0lgo`, `X/0lgp` and the login tab's runnable): takes `LJIIJ`,
 *   which offers Google One Tap only, with no passkey request.
 * - The other-ways lists (`X/0lpT`, `X/0lpS`): leave out the passkey row and keep phone,
 *   password and the rest.
 * - The saved-account list (`OneClickLoginService.LJJ`, which keeps the answer from when the
 *   service was built): leaves saved passkey logins out.
 * - The passkey popup, the after-login passkey hook, the passkey wizard deeplink, the web
 *   bridge's create-passkey handler and Manage account's passkey row: don't show or don't start.
