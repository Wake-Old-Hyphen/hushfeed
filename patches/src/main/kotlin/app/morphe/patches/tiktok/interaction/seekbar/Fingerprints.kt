 * TikTok's "may this video show the progress bar" check, which reads the server's
 * `VideoControl.showProgressBar`. The seek bar asks it before showing ("can not show seekbar,
 * state: 4, can not show progressbar"), and the player asks it before posting play progress, which
 * is what brings the bar back while a video plays.
 *
 * <p>The field read is what pins it. The shape alone (public static final, takes the video,
 * answers a boolean, short, in a class that names a feed tab) fits about twenty methods on 47.1.4,
 * and the patcher took the first in dex order: the ad-traffic check in classes3, ahead of this one
 * in classes4. With the switch on every video then read as an ad, and this check was never
 * answered, so the bar stayed off the For You feed (#134).
