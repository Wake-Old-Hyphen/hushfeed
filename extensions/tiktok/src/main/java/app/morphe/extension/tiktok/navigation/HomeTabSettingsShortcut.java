/**
 * A long press on the Home tab opens Hushfeed's settings (#45), which otherwise sit behind
 * Profile, the menu and TikTok's settings list.
 *
 * <p>TikTok gives that press nothing of its own: on 47.0.3 a held Home acts as a tap. A tab that
 * is already long-clickable when this first sees it is left alone, so a build that does give Home
 * a long press keeps it. Profile's long press is TikTok's account switcher, so not Profile.
 *
 * <p>The tab bar is rebuilt now and then (a tab filter change, a configuration change), so the
 * listener is checked on each layout pass of the main activity, and switching the setting off
 * takes it away again the next time the feed is laid out.
 *
 * <p>TikTok's launcher entry is an alias of MainActivity, so the task can hold two of them, the
 * launcher's under the feed's. Changing TikTok's appearance recreates both, the buried one last,
 * and following the newest one left Home without its long press until TikTok was restarted. The
 * shortcut follows the main activity that is resumed instead ({@link FrontWindow}).
