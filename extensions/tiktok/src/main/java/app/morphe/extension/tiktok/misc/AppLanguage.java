/**
 * The switch in front of Keep the app language (#61).
 *
 * <p>Early in each start TikTok compares the phone's language with the one it saw last time.
 * When a language was picked in TikTok's own settings and it decides the phone's language
 * changed, it clears that pick from {@code key_language_sp_key} and follows the phone again. The
 * #61 reporter's TikTok came up in English after every reboot while its Language page still said
 * Italian, and their own build that skipped this reset stayed Italian. With the switch on the
 * reset returns before it clears anything. With it off, and while Hushfeed is paused, TikTok's
 * reset runs as it ships.
 *
 * <p>The reset runs inside the application's attachBaseContext, before the settings context
 * exists and before ActivityThread has an application, so the switch is read from the saved file
 * through the context TikTok hands the reset. TikTok passes null there sometimes, and then the
 * process's application is tried.
 *
 * <p>Skipping the reset alone wasn't enough: the reporter's TikTok still came up in English after
 * a reboot, with the language page and Hushfeed's settings in Italian. TikTok's own strings come
 * from its reword table, which loads for whatever locale it sees early in the start, and that can
 * be the wrong one right after a boot. Their build that stayed Italian also put the picked
 * language back at the top of the application's onCreate, so the switch does that too: the
 * picked language becomes the process's default, TikTok's own apply puts it on the app's
 * resources, and a reword table already loaded for another language is switched to it.
