/**
 * Keeps the controls of the faded Clear display (#84) on screen. TikTok's Clear display doesn't
 * only take the rail's column and the caption frame to 0: in one frame it sets each button
 * wrapper inside the column to alpha 0 and GONE, the wrapper inside the search bar GONE, and the
 * caption frame and the music disc GONE, so holding the column and the frames at the chosen level
 * showed nothing (emulator, 47.1.4, 2026-10-10). Leaving, it sets the wrappers back to VISIBLE at
 * 0 and animates them up to full over about a third of a second, after a pause of about as long.
 *
 * <p>Which of them were showing is noted as TikTok's clear-mode event arrives, before TikTok
 * handles it, so a wrapper TikTok keeps away outside Clear display (it hides some per post) stays
 * away. While the faded Clear display lasts, the noted views are kept VISIBLE, the wrappers at
 * full so the column's level is what shows. If the fade stops while TikTok is still clear (Pause,
 * or the level set to 0 or 100), each gets back what TikTok had given it. When TikTok leaves Clear
 * display it shows them itself, and the wrappers are held at full through its animation up from
 * 0 so they don't blink out under the column's level.
